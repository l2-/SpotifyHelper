# Spotify Helper

Little .NET project working with WPF.
The idea was to add songs from youtube to spotify with little effort.
For now it only support:
  - Parse text to spotify songs
  - Authentication through spotify so the app can interact with your spotify account
  - Add the songs to your spotify library with a playlist

To do:
Improve UI. (eg. in-app browser for auth, user more spotify data like existing playlists)
Add support for parsing songs from youtube playlist (link).
...Endless possibillities right?
